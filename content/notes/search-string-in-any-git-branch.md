I've been working across a few branches lately, and couldn't remember the name of a git branch containing some work I'd done. I did, however, remember the name of an interface I'd defined.

Seach all git branches for a specific string, with this

```bash
 git rev-list --all | xargs git grep 'SEARCH STRING'
```

If a result is found, you'll be given the git SHA

Get info for the sha

```bash
git show <THE SHA>
```

And you'll see something like this

```
