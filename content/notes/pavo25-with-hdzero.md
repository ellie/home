Recently I've been playing around with FPV drones - I now have a Pavo25 V2. I had an old set of DJI goggles lying around, but the latency/buffering just didn't work for me. I was set on HDZero.

Putting the Freestyle V2 in place of the O3 wasn't too difficult, though a bit fiddly. Sharing this in case it can help anyone else.

The main issue I had was with the connector. Naively, I assumed I'd just be able to plug it in and "it would just work". Nopeee.

The pins are different! Here are the two pinouts

### Freestyle VTX

### FC pins

So yep. They're the other way around

If you look at the top of the JST plug for the VTX, you'll see some little legs. Lift them with a knife/tweezers/something, and you can remove the wires. Put them in the correct order! Make sure TX is connected to RX, and vice versa. 

Here's mine

But yeah, otherwise HDZero is working great with my pavo. OSD fully functions, all good.
